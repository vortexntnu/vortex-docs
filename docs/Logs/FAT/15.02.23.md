## Discovery

If killswitch is on, batteries are plugged in, then xavier works. 
If you remove and apply the killswitch (like a hard reboot) xavier will not turn on. 
If batteries are plugged in but killswitch is off xavier will not turn on. 

**Conclution:**

Xavier sees to turn on when beluga has power, killswitch sees to only affect the xavier when the xavier want to... aka killswitch may or may not affect xavier.
